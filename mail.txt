Hi {first}

By tradition, each PhD student and consulting team member of the SfS gets a t-shirt designed by their peers upon graduation. To collect ideas and images for the t-shirts, I have prepared some polybox folders. If you already have some ideas or a funny image in mind for someone, please upload them to the respective polybox folder.
