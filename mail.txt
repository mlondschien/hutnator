Hi {first}

This time correctly.

Quite a few people are leaving SfS by the end of this year or at the beginning of next year. To simplify preparing ideas for T-shirts, I have set up a polybox folder for each PhD student and member of the statistical consulting team at SfS. If you already have some ideas or pictures in mind, please do already upload them to the respective polybox folder.
